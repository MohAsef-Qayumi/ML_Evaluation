# Machine Learning Model Evaluation App

## Overview
This is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)-based web application designed to facilitate the evaluation of machine learning models. The app allows users to upload their datasets, select features and target variables, choose from a variety of machine learning models, and adjust parameters to train and evaluate the models.

## Features
- **Dataset Upload**: Upload your dataset in CSV or Excel format.
- **Preprocessing Options**: 
  - Select features and target variable.
  - Handle missing values.
  - Standardize numerical features.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from a variety of machine learning models, including:
  - **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine.
  - **Regression**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regressor.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared
- **Visualization**: Visualize results using:
  - Confusion Matrices
  - ROC Curves
  - Scatter Plots
