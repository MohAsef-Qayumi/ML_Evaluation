Machine Learning Model Evaluation App
Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to facilitate the evaluation of machine learning models. The app allows users to upload their datasets, select features and target variables, choose from a variety of machine learning models, and adjust parameters to train and evaluate the models.

Features
Dataset Upload: Upload your dataset in CSV or Excel format.
Preprocessing Options: Select features and target variable, handle missing values, and standardize numerical features.
Model Selection: Choose from a variety of machine learning models, including:
Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine.
Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regressor.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, and R-squared.
Visualization: Visualize results using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and scatter plots.
